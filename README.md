## Mapping Influential Articles in Local Wikipedia Networks via Personalized PageRank and Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search
### Soham Jain & Saye Karthikeyan

The goal of this project is to investigate how PageRank behaves on a subgraph of Wikipedia constructed from a small set of seed articles. By treating Wikipedia as a directed graph, where articles serve as vertices and hyperlinks act as directed edges, we aim to understand how importance acts in this subgraph. Our objective is to determine whether a seed-focused PageRank procedure can reveal meaningful structures and relations, which could serve useful for further application. We seek to also compare these results with Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) to observe the differences that each algorithm gives in importance.

To accomplish this, we first extract a subset of Wikipedia centered around three to four seed articles, recursively gathering linked pages to form a well-defined induced subgraph. We then construct the corresponding Markov transition matrix and apply personalized PageRank, biasing the random-walk distribution toward the chosen seeds. This personalization allows us to emphasize specific topics in our subgraph, effectively influencing steady-state probabilities within the subgraph. Finally, we visualize the resulting directed graph, emphasizing according to the computed PageRank scores to provide an interpretable presentation of article importance.
